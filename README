Modified StrandedBlock from 1.1, meant to be used with other mods. 
Use chemical plant to extract resources from water. 
Rush steel for more chemical plants. 
You still need military to clear nearby island to expand.
Incompatible with mods that adds some kind of new ore patches, but you can just add that in the recipe.lua yourself.
Space Age planets are not affected
Some weird enemy bases :D
BEWARE: I'M NOT A PROFESSIONAL PROGRAMMER/SCRIPTER

Improvements are welcome!
